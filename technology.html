                <p>Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία,
                    -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods
                    or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can
                    be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow
                    for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying
                    technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an
                    outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.</p>

                <p>The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric invention
                    of shaped stone tools followed by the discovery of how to control fire increased sources of food.
                    The later Neolithic Revolution extended this, and quadrupled the sustenance available from a
                    territory. The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high
                        technology and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology
                        is uncertain.</li>
                    <li>Genetics have also been explored, with humans understanding genetic engineering to a certain
                        degree. However, gene editing is widely divisive, and usually involves some degree of eugenics.
                        Some have speculated the future of human engineering to include 'super humans,' humans who have
                        been genetically engineered to be faster, stronger, and more survivable than current humans.
                    </li>
                    <li>TThe 'GNR revolution,' would bring a new age of technology and advancement for humanity like
                        none that has been seen before.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This discovery could pave the way for many scientific and medical advancements, such as curing new diseases, or inventing new, more efficient technology. </p>
